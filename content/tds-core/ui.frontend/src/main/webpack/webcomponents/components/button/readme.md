This is an example of a basic button group web component built using LitElement. The component takes an array of buttons, which should be an array of objects that contain the label and value of each button, and a selected property that will be used to keep track of which button is currently selected. The component also uses a selectButton method to select a button by value and dispatches a 'selected' event with the value of the selected button. Finally, the component is using Lit's css decorator to apply some basic styling.
